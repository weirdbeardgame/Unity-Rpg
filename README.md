# Unity-Rpg
Wip unity rpg engine that is free and opensource. Several tested systems like a functioning inventory and item system. 
* Battle system that's in refractor status right now.
* Quest system that's in refractor status right now
* Engine flag system to set current game state.
* Npc editor that includes npc events for dialogue follow and other pieces reated to cutscene or quests.
* Weapon / armor system that includes appendage slots for weapon armor types and application of buffers to each appendage slot
This engine is lacking a proper pause menu UI right now.
